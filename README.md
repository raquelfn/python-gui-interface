# python-gui-interface
A GUI-based simulator for estimating the thickness of thin films produced by thermal evaporation, used in nuclear physics target design. This tool models the evaporator at the Target Design Laboratory (TDL) of LIP (FCUL), helping researchers and students obtain accurate thickness predictions.

Key Features

Estimates film thickness for deposition processes

User-friendly interface for simulations

Designed specifically for target design in nuclear physics experiments

Quick Start

Install required libraries (see requirements.txt)
Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook
Click "Simulate Deposition" to start the simulation

Tip: Running in Jupyter Notebook avoids a known Tkinter issue where the GUI window may resize and affect frame behavior when using standard Python.
